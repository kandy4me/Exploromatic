{"name":"Exploromatic","tagline":"Beaglebone Black + ROS + 4WD RC Truck + more!","body":"# Introducting the explor-O-matic\r\nThe explorOmatic is an autonomous RC Truck based around a Beaglebone Black and Robot Operating System (ROS).  It has no aim in particular, but serves to be a platform for experimenting.  In this vein it should have bi-directional communication and a good interface, which is accomplished through Ubuntu over a SSH connection.  The initial version of the greenOmatic will essentially be a remote-controlled RC truck with all on-board sensors constantly being updated and reported.  Lets call this version 1.0.\r\n\r\nThe next version of the greenOmatic will implement SLAM to create a precise map of the perimeter of any arbitrary indoor unit (multiple rooms).  This could be useful to real-estate businesses for verifying the layout of floor plans.  However, let's not get ahead of ourselves, Version 1.0 is still in the works!\r\n\r\n\r\n# Hardware\r\n\r\n## 4WD Remote-Control Truck\r\nI got very lucky on a trip to Value village, and found this great RC truck.  It's 4-wheel-drive, has a decent suspension system, and has a pretty hefty drive motor.  The steering motor was of an old Design (5 wire analog control), so rather than figure out how this works I swapped it out for a modern Servo.\r\n\r\n## Beagelbone Black\r\n\r\n## SyRen 10 Motor Controller\r\n\r\n## LS20031 GPS Receiver\r\n\r\n## URM37 Ultrasonic Sensors\r\n\r\n## DHT11/DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensors\r\n\r\n## NiMH Batteries\r\n\r\n\r\n# Software\r\n\r\n## Ubuntu 14.04 for ARMHF\r\n\r\n# Robot Operating System (ROS)\r\n","google":"UA-22581448-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
